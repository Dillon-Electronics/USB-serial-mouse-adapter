# Work in progesss

While KiCad files are available, I have to yet to get my hands on a made up board.

Please Note: This is the first time I've ever designed a PCB from scratch, so there may be a newbie mistake or two. 

# SDK
Use the 1.2.0 version of the Pico SDK with TinyUSB version 10.1
11 or greater don't work very well at the moment and I really don't know why. I've heard that I'm not the only one with this issue and I know from testing that if you take the tuh_hid_*_cb functions and put them into their own project on their own, they work fine. So I have no idea. 

# KiCad
I do hope that the KiCad files are "final" by now. Waiting on my own order to arrive.
