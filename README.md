## About
This project came about when I got my hands on an old 486 based PC. Having never really dipped my toes into retro computing, I didn't have an old serial mouse on hand. A quick eBay searched revealed that the decent ones cost a nice chunk of change that I didn't feel they were worth. Another search on Vogons revealed that some mad lads out there made active PS/2 to serial adapters using various micro controllers.  
Out of curiosity I examined how these worked and thought "Why can't I do this with a Pi Pico and USB mouse?" which kicked off this project. 

I hope it sparks your interest!
